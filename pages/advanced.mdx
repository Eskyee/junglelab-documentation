# Advanced Guide

Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that can be easily integrated with popular platforms like GitHub and GitLab. Installing and setting up Codespaces can be done in a few simple steps, and the platform provides a wide range of tools and resources to help you get started quickly.

Here is a guide to install and set up Codespaces for your project:

Step 1: Sign up for a GitHub or GitLab account if you don't have one already.

Step 2: Open the GitHub or GitLab repository for your project. If you don't have a repository yet, you can create a new one.

Step 3: In the repository, click on the "Actions" or "CI/CD" tab, and then select "Set up a workflow."

Step 4: Select "Use a template" from the list of options, and then choose the Codespaces template.

Step 5: Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the workflow, specifying the environment and tools you need.

Step 6: Commit the changes to your repository, and Codespaces will automatically set up your development environment.

Step 7: To access your Codespaces environment, simply click on the "Codespaces" tab in your repository.

Documentation for JungleLab and its features and tools is available on the JungleLab website and in the project's repository. The documentation provides detailed information on how to use JungleLab to create and manage your projects, as well as how to take advantage of its many features and tools to streamline your development process.

Whether you're just getting started with Codespaces or you're an experienced user, the platform provides a wealth of resources and support to help you make the most of your development environment. So why not give it a try today, and see how it can help you build and manage your projects more effectively!


Here are some steps you can follow to teach new developers how to contribute to JungleLab development:

Set up a development environment: Make sure the new developers have all the necessary tools and dependencies installed on their machines, such as Node.js, a code editor, and any required libraries or frameworks.
Familiarize them with the codebase: Give the new developers a tour of the codebase and explain the architecture and design patterns being used. This will help them understand how the different parts of the application fit together and how they can contribute.
Identify areas for improvement: Work with the new developers to identify areas of the codebase that could benefit from improvements or new features. This could be through code review, user testing, or feedback from other developers.
Break down tasks into smaller chunks: Assign specific tasks or features to the new developers and break them down into smaller, manageable chunks. This will make it easier for them to focus on one task at a time and see the progress they are making.
Review and provide feedback: As the new developers work on their tasks, make sure to review their code and provide feedback. This will help them learn and improve their skills as they continue to contribute to the project.
Encourage collaboration: Encourage the new developers to collaborate with other team members and seek help when needed. This will help them learn from their peers and build relationships with other developers.
Foster a culture of continuous learning: Encourage the new developers to continue learning and expanding their skills. This could be through online courses, conference talks, or simply staying up to date with industry news and best practices.

To build JungleLab, you will need to follow these steps:

Install the necessary tools and dependencies. This includes a code editor, version control system (such as Git), and any libraries or frameworks that JungleLab uses (such as Svelte Kit, Tailwind CSS, and LiquidJS).
Set up a local development environment. This involves creating a local copy of the JungleLab codebase, installing any necessary libraries or dependencies, and configuring the necessary configuration files (such as vite.config.js).
Begin coding! You can work on any feature or bug fix that you think would improve JungleLab. Follow the coding standards and guidelines set by the JungleLab team, and make sure to write clean, well-documented code.
Test your code. Make sure to thoroughly test any changes you make to ensure that they work as intended. This might involve running unit tests, integration tests, or manually testing the code in a development environment.
Submit your changes for review. Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can submit them for review by the JungleLab team. This usually involves creating a pull request on GitHub, which will be reviewed by other members of the team before being merged into the main codebase.
Deploy your changes. After your changes have been reviewed and approved, they will be deployed to the live JungleLab platform. This might involve building and deploying a new version of the app, or updating the configuration of the platform.
Overall, building JungleLab involves working with a team of developers to improve and maintain the platform, using a variety of tools and technologies. It requires strong coding skills, attention to detail, and a willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies as needed.
